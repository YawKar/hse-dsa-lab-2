# Problem Statement and Constraints
## Problem statement
Given rectangles on a two-dimensional plane, the task is to respond as quickly as possible to the query "How many rectangles does the point (x,y) belong to?".

## Constraints
### Rectangles
Each rectangle is defined by a pair of coordinates of its bottom-left and top-right corners: `x1 y1 x2 y2`.

Where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` satisfy the following conditions:
- `x1, y1, x2, y2` are integers
- `0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 1e9`
- `x1 < x2`
- `y1 < y2`

C++ `Rectangle` class implementation:
```cpp
class Rectangle {
public:
    Point leftDown;
    Point rightUp;

    Rectangle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) : leftDown(x1, y1), rightUp(x2, y2) {}
    Rectangle(const Point& leftDown_, const Point& rightUp_) : leftDown(leftDown_), rightUp(rightUp_) {}
};
```

### Points
Each point is defined by a pair of its coordinates: `x y`.

Where `x` and `y` satisfy the following conditions:
- `x, y` are integers
- `-1e9 <= x, y <= 1e9`
C++ `Point` class implementation:
```cpp
class Point {
public:
    int x;
    int y;

    Point(int x_ = 0, int y_ = 0) : x(x_), y(y_) {}
};
```

# Utilized Software Toolset
## C++
To conduct the laboratory work, the compiled language C++ was chosen. 
The C++ language was used to implement the algorithms. The version of the compiler used was GCC 11.3.0. The compilation flags were set to `-O3` to enable maximum optimization. The program was run on a machine with the following specifications:
| Property       | Value                                     |

An alternative in the form of Java was also considered, but it was decided to abandon it due to the uncertainty and noise that various runtime optimizations (warming up) and garbage collection introduce into measurements. Configuring the JVM for benchmarking is quite difficult and requires a proper level of expertise, which I'm afraid I don't have.

## Conan 2.0
For the convenience of development, source distribution, and library dependency management, I decided to use the modern package manager Conan 2.0. Thanks to it, to connect all dependencies and run the project, it is necessary to execute only a limited set of commands, which, after initial configuration of Conan, will be reduced to 2 commands: `cmake --build .`, `./lab_benchmark`.

## CMake
The project's build system is based on the industry standard - CMake. The .cmake files generated by Conan are used for building.

## Google Benchmark
I'm using the [Google Benchmark library](https://github.com/google/benchmark) for benchmarks, which I've included via Conan. It has a wide API and is very easy to use.

# Test Case Generation
To generate test cases for the problem, it was suggested to generate rectangles according to a certain rule:
- The recommended approach for generating a test set of rectangles is to use a set of nested rectangles with coordinates that have a step size greater than 1, such as `{(10*i, 10*i), (10*(2*N-i), 10*(2*N-i))}`.

As for generating points, it was advised to generate them somehow uniformly across the entire plane.

I decided to encapsulate test generation logic inside of the `TestCaseGenerator` class:
```cpp
class TestCaseGenerator {
public:
    static std::vector<Rectangle> generateRecommendedRectangles(int rectangles);
    static std::vector<Point> generateUniformlyDistributedPoints(
        int numberOfPoints, 
        int minX, 
        int maxX, 
        int minY, 
        int maxY, 
        int xSeed = std::random_device()(), 
        int ySeed = std::random_device()());
};
```
Implementation of `generateRecommendedRectangles`:
```cpp
std::vector<Rectangle> TestCaseGenerator::generateRecommendedRectangles(int numberOfRectangles) {
    std::vector<Rectangle> rects;
    rects.reserve(numberOfRectangles);
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfRectangles; ++i) {
        rects.emplace_back(10 * i, 10 * i, 10 * (2 * numberOfRectangles - i), 10 * (2 * numberOfRectangles - i));
    }
    return rects;
}
```
Implementation of `generateUniformlyDistributedPoints`:
```cpp
std::vector<Point> TestCaseGenerator::generateUniformlyDistributedPoints(int numberOfPoints, int minX, int maxX, int minY, int maxY, int xSeed, int ySeed) {
    std::mt19937 xEngine(xSeed);
    std::mt19937 yEngine(ySeed);
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> xDist(minX, maxX);
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> yDist(minY, maxY);

    std::vector<Point> points;
    points.reserve(numberOfPoints);
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfPoints; ++i) {
        points.emplace_back(xDist(xEngine), yDist(yEngine));
    }
    return points;
}
```

# First Approach: Naive Brute Force Algorithm
The first approach does not involve any data preprocessing. All rectangles are stored in a vector "as is". To obtain the answer for a specific point, we iterate over all rectangles and check two conditions: whether the given point is within this rectangle on both axes.

As I've mentioned before, there is no data preprocessing:
```cpp
void NaiveRectangleEnumeration::buildInternals() {}
```
The brute force implementation of query:
```cpp
int NaiveRectangleEnumeration::queryPoint(const Point& point)
{
    int answer = 0;
    for (const auto& rectangle : this->rectangles) {
        if (rectangle.leftDown.x <= point.x && point.x <= rectangle.rightUp.x &&
            rectangle.leftDown.y <= point.y && point.y <= rectangle.rightUp.y) {
                ++answer;
        }
    }
    return answer;
}
```

# Second Approach: Compressed Coordinate Map Construction
The second approach involves compressing the coordinates of all the rectangle points along both axes. We create a two-dimensional array over the compressed points, initially filled with zeros. Then, for each rectangle, we add `1` to each cell of the two-dimensional array that is located under the rectangle. As a result, we obtain a "height map", where the value of `map[i][j]` equals the number of rectangles that cover the two-dimensional compressed subspace at the point `(i, j)`.

To find the answer for a given point `(x, y)`, we will search for the indexes of the compressed coordinates along both axes. Specifically, we will look for **the largest compressed coordinate that is less than or equal to** the corresponding coordinate of the point. Once we find the compressed coordinates of the point, we check whether the point is inside the working area. If it is, we simply return the value of `map[zipped.x][zipped.y]`. Otherwise, the point is outside the bounds of the working area, and the answer is `0`.

Implementation of coordinate compression and map building:
```cpp
void QubicMapBuilding::buildInternals() {
    for (const auto& rect : this->rectangles) {
        this->zippedXs.push_back(rect.leftDown.x);  // Here we accumulate all x-es
        this->zippedXs.push_back(rect.rightUp.x);   // 
        this->zippedYs.push_back(rect.leftDown.y);  // and y-es of both rectangle corners
        this->zippedYs.push_back(rect.rightUp.y);
    }
    
    // Next, we need to sort these coordinates in order to effectively delete duplicates
    std::sort(this->zippedXs.begin(), this->zippedXs.end());
    std::sort(this->zippedYs.begin(), this->zippedYs.end());
    this->zippedXs.erase(std::unique(this->zippedXs.begin(), this->zippedXs.end()), this->zippedXs.end());
    this->zippedYs.erase(std::unique(this->zippedYs.begin(), this->zippedYs.end()), this->zippedYs.end());

    // Allocate two-dimensional map with '0' as default value
    this->map.resize(zippedXs.size());
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < zippedXs.size(); ++i) {
        this->map[i].resize(this->zippedYs.size());
    }

    // This takes O(n^3) operations to build the final "height map".
    for (const auto& rect : this->rectangles) {
        Point zippedLeftDown(findPos(this->zippedXs, rect.leftDown.x), findPos(this->zippedYs, rect.leftDown.y));
        Point zippedRightUp(findPos(this->zippedXs, rect.rightUp.x), findPos(this->zippedYs, rect.rightUp.y));
        for (int xIdx = zippedLeftDown.x; xIdx < zippedRightUp.x + 1; ++xIdx) {
            for (int yIdx = zippedLeftDown.y; yIdx < zippedRightUp.y + 1; ++yIdx) {
                ++this->map[xIdx][yIdx];
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Implementation of query:
```cpp
int QubicMapBuilding::queryPoint(const Point& point)
{
    Point zipped(findPos(this->zippedXs, point.x), findPos(this->zippedYs, point.y));
    if (zipped.x == this->zippedXs.size() || // `point` is to the right of the rightmost point of rectangles
        zipped.y == this->zippedYs.size() || // `point` is higher than the highest point of rectangles
        (zipped.x == 0 && point.x < this->zippedXs[0]) || // `point` is to the left of the leftmost point of rectangles
        (zipped.y == 0 && point.y < this->zippedYs[0]) // `point` is lower than the lowest point of rectangles
        ) {
        return 0; // `point` is out of the bounds
    }
    return this->map[zipped.x][zipped.y];
}
```
Implementation of the util method `findPos(..)` that performs search for compressed indexes:
```cpp
int QubicMapBuilding::findPos(std::vector<int>& items, int target) {
    return std::upper_bound(items.begin(), items.end(), target) - items.begin() - 1;
}
```

# Third Approach: Lazy Persistent Segment Tree on Compressed Coordinates
The third approach requires prior knowledge of lazy persistent segment trees. After reviewing the definition and implementation of the "Lazy Persistent Segment Tree", we will be ready to proceed with the final solution.

## Lazy Persistent Segment Tree
The solution requires a lazy persistent segment tree, which stores a number in each node and allows for fast addition/subtraction of a number on random subsegments `[l; r)`.

Let's start by describing the structure of a node. The node will contain three fields: a pointer to the left child, a pointer to the right child, and the accumulated sum in the node. By default, the pointers are `nullptr`, and the sum is `0`.
```cpp
struct Node {
    std::shared_ptr<Node> left = nullptr;
    std::shared_ptr<Node> right = nullptr;
    int summ = 0;
};
```

We implement the operation of adding/subtracting a number on a subsegment through lazy propagation until we descend to a node that corresponds to a subsegment covered by the target subsegment (`// Condition 2`). In this case, we create a new copy of the node to maintain persistence and increase/decrease the accumulated sum of the copy by the given number.

If we have descended to a node that corresponds to a subsegment not covered by the target subsegment (`// Condition 1`), then in this case, we simply return a pointer to the current node, without applying any changes.

Otherwise, we recursively descend into both children of the current root, creating these children if they did not exist. **This is the "laziness" of this segment tree, it builds itself only as needed**.

In essence, this function returns new root node that corresponds to new 'state' of the segment tree.
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<PersistentSegmentTree::Node> PersistentSegmentTree::addWithPersistence(
    std::shared_ptr<Node> root, 
    int left, 
    int right, 
    int rangeStart, 
    int rangeEnd, 
    int value) {
    if (left >= rangeEnd || right <= rangeStart) { // Condition 1
        return root;
    }
    if (rangeStart <= left && right <= rangeEnd) { // Condition 2
        std::shared_ptr<Node> newRoot(new Node(*root));
        newRoot->summ += value;
        return newRoot;
    }
    int middle = (left + right) / 2;
    std::shared_ptr<Node> newRoot(new Node(*root));
    if (newRoot->left == nullptr) newRoot->left = std::shared_ptr<Node>(new Node);
    newRoot->left = addWithPersistence(newRoot->left, left, middle, rangeStart, rangeEnd, value);
    if (newRoot->right == nullptr) newRoot->right = std::shared_ptr<Node>(new Node);
    newRoot->right = addWithPersistence(newRoot->right, middle, right, rangeStart, rangeEnd, value);
    return newRoot;
}
```

Now, we can use root of the tree to collect information about how many subsegments cover the point `x`. In order to perform that we need to descend to the lowest hanging node that is exist and is covering the point `x`. We can do it using binary search:
```cpp
int PersistentSegmentTree::getTotalSum(std::shared_ptr<Node> root, int left, int right, int targetIdx) {
    if (right - left == 1) {
        return root->summ;
    }
    int middle = (left + right) / 2;
    if (targetIdx < middle) {
        if (root->left == nullptr) return root->summ;
        return root->summ + getTotalSum(root->left, left, middle, targetIdx);
    } else {
        if (root->right == nullptr) return root->summ;
        return root->summ + getTotalSum(root->right, middle, right, targetIdx);
    }
}
```
If the current root corresponds to a subsegment of length `1`, then we simply return the accumulated sum. Otherwise, firstly, we calculate the middle point of the `[left; right)` subsegment, and depending on the location of the `targetIdx`, we recursively dive into the left or right branch if the branch exists. If it doesn't exist, we return the root's accumulated sum.

## Key idea: event-driven updates with preservation of the history of tree state
The key idea of the solution is to update the tree for each column (each compressed x-coordinate) in the order of increasing columns from left to right, preserving the new roots of the persistent segment tree and their corresponding compressed coordinates. Then, when a query point arrives, we use binary search to find the index of the compressed coordinate along the x-axis, retrieve the tree root that was saved at the time of processing events for that x-coordinate, and perform a standard one-dimensional query along the y-coordinate, obtaining the answer in `O(log(n))`.

## Coordinate compression
Coordinate compression is implemented in a similar way as it was in the 2nd approach. The only difference is that we add not just rectangle's corners coordinates but also coordinates of the point that is 1 unit higher and 1 unit to the right of the right upper corner of the rectangle. We will need these coordinates for correct compressing of point coordinates and assignment of events' coordinates as well as for one-dimensional (along the y-coordinate) querying on segment tree.
```cpp
void PersistentSegmentTree::makeZippedCoordsFromRectangles() {
    for (const auto& rect : this->rectangles) {
        this->zippedXs.push_back(rect.leftDown.x);
        this->zippedXs.push_back(rect.rightUp.x);
        this->zippedXs.push_back(rect.rightUp.x + 1); // We add 
    }
    
    std::sort(this->zippedXs.begin(), this->zippedXs.end());
    this->zippedXs.erase(std::unique(this->zippedXs.begin(), this->zippedXs.end()), this->zippedXs.end());
    this->zippedXs.shrink_to_fit();

    for (const auto& rect : this->rectangles) {
        this->zippedYs.push_back(rect.leftDown.y);
        this->zippedYs.push_back(rect.rightUp.y);
        this->zippedYs.push_back(rect.rightUp.y + 1);
    }

    std::sort(this->zippedYs.begin(), this->zippedYs.end());
    this->zippedYs.erase(std::unique(this->zippedYs.begin(), this->zippedYs.end()), this->zippedYs.end());
    this->zippedYs.shrink_to_fit();
}
```

## Events construction
Every rectangle has 4 sides. We need to create a sequence of sorted events each of which represents left or right side of a rectangle.

Let's consider the structure of an event:
```cpp
struct Event {
    int zippedXIdx;
    bool isOpening;
    int zippedYIdxStart;
    int zippedYIdxEnd;
    Event(int zippedXIdx_, bool isOpening_, int zippedYIdxStart_, int zippedYIdxEnd_) 
    : zippedXIdx(zippedXIdx_), isOpening(isOpening_), zippedYIdxStart(zippedYIdxStart_), zippedYIdxEnd(zippedYIdxEnd_) {}
};
```
There `zippedXIdx` is the compressed x-coordinate of the left or right side of some rectangle. `isOpening` is a marker representing whether it is a left or right side (left if `true`, `false` otherwise, because we process events from left to right along the x-axis and the left side 'opens' the rectangle, whereas the right side `closes` it). `zippedYIdxStart` is the compressed y-coordinate of the left bottom corner of the rectangle, and also it is the beginning of the subsegment that corresponds to that rectangle's side. `zippedYIdxEnd` is the compressed y-coordinate of the point 1 unit higher and 1 unit to the right of the right top corner of the rectangle, and also it is the exclusive end of the subsegment that corresponds to that rectangle's side.

Now checkout the implementation of events creation:
```cpp
void PersistentSegmentTree::buildInternals() {
    makeZippedCoordsFromRectangles(); // Compresse rectangles' coordinates and save compressed into `this->zippedXs` and `this->zippedYs`

    std::vector<Event> events;                      // Place where we will store our events.
    events.reserve(2 * this->rectangles.size());    // Reserve 2 * 'number of rectangles' memory so the vector won't need to reallocate memory.

    for (const auto& rect : this->rectangles) {
        events.emplace_back(                            // Opening event:
            findPos(this->zippedXs, rect.leftDown.x),   // zippedX index,
            1,                                          // isOpening = true,
            findPos(this->zippedYs, rect.leftDown.y),   // zippedYRangeStart: beginning of the subsegment on which we should add 1,
            findPos(this->zippedYs, rect.rightUp.y + 1) // zippedYRangeEnd: if subsegment is [l; r], it equals to 'r + 1',
        );                                              // so we can perform addition on [l; r + 1).
        events.emplace_back(                            // Closing event:
            findPos(this->zippedXs, rect.rightUp.x + 1),// zippedX index,
            0,                                          // isOpening = false,
            findPos(this->zippedYs, rect.leftDown.y),   // zippedYRangeStart: beginning of the subsegment on which we should subtract 1,
            findPos(this->zippedYs, rect.rightUp.y + 1) // zippedYRangeEnd: if subsegment is [l; r], it equals to 'r + 1',
        );                                              // so we can perform subtraction on [l; r + 1).
    }

    this->rectangles.clear();           // We clear the vector containing rectangles
    this->rectangles.shrink_to_fit();   // and shrink its capacity so it frees the allocated memory. 
                                        // If you don't do it, you may face MLE (Memory Limit Exceeded) status. Or may not, I didn't check it.

    std::sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const Event& e1, const Event& e2) {  // Sort events in ascending order according to their
        return e1.zippedXIdx < e2.zippedXIdx;                                       // zipped x-coordinates.
    });

    std::shared_ptr<Node> root(new Node);   // Create empty (for a while) root

    int prevZippedX = events[0].zippedXIdx; // Remember the zipped x-coordinate of the first event.
    for (std::size_t eventIdx = 0; eventIdx < events.size(); ++eventIdx) {  // Iterate over all events.
        if (events[eventIdx].zippedXIdx != prevZippedX) {   // If current event is not on the same zipped x-coordinate,
            this->roots.push_back(root);                    // preserve current root
            this->zippedRootsXIdxs.push_back(prevZippedX);  // and the corresponding zipped x-coordinate.
            prevZippedX = events[eventIdx].zippedXIdx;      // Update current 'working on' zipped x-coordinate.
        }
        root = addWithPersistence(                                            // Perform the 'event' (obtaining new root because of persistence)
            root,                                                             // on the 'root' root
            0, this->zippedYs.size(),                                         // with the segment tree's leftmost index and rightmost (exclusive)
            events[eventIdx].zippedYIdxStart, events[eventIdx].zippedYIdxEnd, // on subsegment [zippedYIdxStart, zippedYIdxEnd)
            events[eventIdx].isOpening ? 1 : -1                               // adding/subtracting 1.
            );
    }
    this->zippedRootsXIdxs.push_back(prevZippedX);  // Save the last root's zipped x-coordinate.
    this->roots.push_back(root);                    // Preserve the last updated root (Invariant is: all of this root's nodes contain zero as their sum).
}
```

After that we will have a set of persisted roots of the segment tree each with the corresponding compressed x-coordinate. It's time to review the final method that will query points in `O(log(N))`.

## Querying points
Initially, we need to check whether the point is even within the working area, if it isn't we can simply return 0 as it guarantees that the point is out of bounds of any rectangle.

If the point is within the working area, we find the corresponding compressed coordinates, which will be the maximum coordinates that are also less than or equal to those of the point. Then, in the array of saved compressed x-coordinates of the roots of the persistent segment tree, we find the root with the maximum index of compressed x-coordinate that is also less than or equal to that of the compressed input point. Once we obtain the root, we simply perform a one-dimensional query on it to obtain the accumulated sum over all subsegments that include the compressed y-coordinate of the point.
```cpp
int PersistentSegmentTree::queryPoint(const Point& point) {
    if (point.x > this->zippedXs.back() || // `point` is to the right of the rightmost point of rectangles
        point.y > this->zippedYs.back() || // `point` is higher than the highest point of rectangles
        point.x < this->zippedXs.front() || // `point` is to the left of the leftmost point of rectangles
        point.y < this->zippedYs.front() // `point` is lower than the lowest point of rectangles
        ) {
        return 0; // `point` is out of the bounds
    }
    int zippedXIdx = findUpperPos(this->zippedXs, point.x) - 1; // Find compressed x-coordinate of the point.
    int zippedYIdx = findUpperPos(this->zippedYs, point.y) - 1; // Find compressed y-coordinate of the point.
    // Find the required root:
    std::shared_ptr<Node> targetRoot = this->roots[findUpperPos(this->zippedRootsXIdxs, zippedXIdx) - 1];
    // Return the result of query on the 'targetRoot' (one-dimensional query on a rectangle's side)
    return getTotalSum(targetRoot, 0, this->zippedYs.size(), zippedYIdx);
}
```
Implementation of the util method `findUpperPos(..)` that performs search for compressed indexes that are `>`:
```cpp
int PersistentSegmentTree::findUpperPos(std::vector<int>& items, int target) {
    return std::upper_bound(items.begin(), items.end(), target) - items.begin();
}
```
Implementation of the util method `findPos(..)` that performs search for compressed indexes that are `>=`:
```cpp
int PersistentSegmentTree::findPos(std::vector<int>& items, int target) {
    return std::lower_bound(items.begin(), items.end(), target) - items.begin();
}
```

# Benchmark Graphs, Comparison, and Thoughts
Each of the algorithms performs some preprocessing (except for the first algorithm) with its own asymptotic complexity. At the same time, each of the algorithms responds to queries in its own way. Therefore, I decided to divide the measurements into:
- Time complexity of building the internal structure of the algorithm
- Average time complexity per one query to the constructed data structure

## Time complexity of building the internal structure of the algorithm

# Installation
## How to setup and run
1. Install conan 2.0
2. [Optional] Create conan profile if you haven't yet: `conan profile detect --force`. This will create new default profile for conan in your system.
3. Install CMake of version not less than the one that is specified in CMakeLists.txt
3. `cd` to the root folder of the project
4. `conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing`
5. `cd build`
6. `cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
7. `cmake --build .`
8. `./conan_template`

Now make a tea and eat some cookies. You're awesome.
